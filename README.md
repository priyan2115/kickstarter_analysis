### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This table and chart describes the outcome based on GOALS of PLAYS "subcategory". The goals are differentiate into 5000 ranges from <1000 to >50,000.
    - first we can see that there are no canceled PLAYS.So, outcomes divided into only 2 parts; Successful and Fail category.
    - There are only 0 successful and 1 fail outcome shown between the range of 45,000 to 49,999.So the persentage of success is 0 and for fail it displays 100% between this range.
    - into, percentage of successful outcome coloumn 67% is repetative number for 35,000 to 39,999 and 40,000 to 44,999. there are also repatative number for same ranges of goal coloumn in fail category which is 33%.
    - for the PLAYS category the percentage of fails is more than 6 times in compare to successful coloumn.
    - Basically, when the ratio of success is increase the ratio of fail is declined and vise versa. it happens because there are no canceled Plays under subcategory.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

-**** What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

## conclution no 1:
     As we can conclude that ratio of successful and failed outcomes are always above the 100,while the ratio of canceled and live outcomes are always below the 50 in every months. As well as there is live outcomes visible for january,fabruary and march..after march there is no live outcomes are visible.

## conclution no 2:
    In the Grand total column it can be easily shown that ratio is always between 250 to 400 in every months it can't visible under 250 or below 400. On the other side we can clearly see that more than 50% of outcomes values are under the Successful category and remaining are canceled,failed and live.

- **What are some limitations of this dataset?
**
remaining..

- **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
I found that one table which is based on currency from which we can found the outcomes and chart from that table too.

## Link:
[Kickstarter_Challenge](C:\Users\raman\Desktop\modual 1 challange/to/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlxs
"outcomebased on currency"  is located on the page "Outcomes based on Goal" in kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx

 There is also possible tables from filtering on outcomes values with launch date like "theater outcomes by launchdate" table and chart. for example: food,game,music,so on.
